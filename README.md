Algebra expression in, pretty-printed algebra expression out. 

Well, for now. In the near future, I'd like this thing to out say the solutions, the derivative, the integration, the fourrier transform, I don't know. Things. 

You can't even build it right now. I use it by importing the files in the Scala REPL and messing around it by hand. I'l fix that as soon as it does something interesting.
